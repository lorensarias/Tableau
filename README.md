# NYC Real Estate Data Analysis with Tableau 

## Project Objective 
To determine the most strategic borough in New York City for real estate investment by identifying the borough with the lowest current home prices and the highest potential for property value growth. The analysis will compare the affordability of homes across all five boroughs (Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island), evaluate market trends, and identify the optimal timing for purchasing a property. This will inform investment decisions based on both short-term affordability and long-term appreciation potential.

## Data Sourcing 

The data for this project is the "Rolling sales data," available on NYC Department of Finance. It contains multiple, related files from each City and the sales from 2016 and 2017. The raw data can be found [here](https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/property/property-rolling-sales-data.page).
